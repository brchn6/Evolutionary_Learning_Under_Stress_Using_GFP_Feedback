Adaptive evolution of organisms in changing environments proceeds via a complex interplay of genetic and epigenetic changes, mediated by mechanisms of selection and phenotypic plasticity. In stable environmental conditions, there is a preference for established solutions embedded within the genetic repertoire. However, when an organism encounters a novel environmental challenge not covered by this repertoire, unconventional pathways are recruited: increased variability in gene expression, activation of general stress response pathways, and sometimes even accelerated mutational processes under stress conditions. Controlled evolution experiments in yeast have demonstrated the molecular and phenotypic changes occurring across multiple generations when populations are exposed to chronic stresses, such as elevated temperature or high salinity. Accumulating experimental evidence from microbial systems indicates that extreme environmental stress, such as heat, extreme pH, or exposure to radicals, triggers the activation of unique mutagenesis pathways. In yeast and bacterial models, it has been found that the mutation rate, including chromosomal rearrangements, increases in a stress-dependent manner, thus enhancing the probability of generating variants with improved adaptive fitness (Foster, 2007). This mechanism, known as stress-induced mutagenesis, represents an adaptive strategy that allows populations to overcome fitness landscape barriers while maintaining overall viability.

In a recent experiment, clonal yeast populations were cultured under controlled conditions in a microfluidic chip, maintaining a constant population size. During exposure to 39°C a non-lethal but challenging heat stress a feedback mechanism was applied: as yeast cells produced more GFP (as an indicator of adaptive pathway activity), the temperature was gradually decreased toward optimal values. Observations demonstrated plasticity in the relevant gene activities, showing a significant increase in GFP expression followed by a gradual decrease in temperature, stabilizing around 34–35°C. This behavior illustrates a process of adaptive learning mediated by environmental feedback. The computational model accompanying the experiment describes a population in which the probability of transition between phenotypes (“GFP-expressing” vs. “non-expressing”) depends on the intensity of environmental stress: under high stress, the rate of phenotypic switching increases, while at low stress, relative phenotypic stability is achieved. The model is inspired by barostat frameworks and incorporates feedback dynamics the cell receives a “reward” (stress reduction) when activating an adaptive pathway. This allows the analysis of evolutionary-learning dynamics in populations under fluctuating environmental pressure.

Quantitative models in evolutionary biology show that transiently accelerated mutagenesis under stress enables populations to bypass fitness valleys and achieve complex adaptive solutions with reduced adaptation time. Dynamic switching between phenotypes often mediated by complex regulatory responses enables populations to cope with dynamic environmental conditions without significantly compromising long-term mean fitness. This preserves an optimal balance between adaptability and adaptedness. The proposed model provides an analytical and experimental platform for studying mechanisms of evolutionary learning under dynamic stress conditions, integrating environmental feedback, stress-dependent selection, and regulated phenotypic transitions. Combining empirical data from microfluidic systems with theoretical analysis enables characterization of the conditions under which adaptive learning is maximized, and evaluation of the impact of feedforward and feedback mechanisms on population dynamics both in laboratory and beyond. This framework may lay the foundation for exploring the general principles of biological adaptation and evolutionary innovation.
