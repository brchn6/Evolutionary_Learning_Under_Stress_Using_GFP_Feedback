**Authors**: Dan Weinberg, Benel Levy, Bar Cohen  
**Course**: Evolution Through Programming  
**Project**: Simulating Adaptive Dynamics in Synthetic Yeast Populations

## üìå Overview

This project simulates adaptive evolution in a synthetic biology system where **yeast cells express GFP** (a fluorescent reporter gene), and the **environmental temperature dynamically adjusts based on population-level GFP expression**.

The key idea: **Cells shape the environment through collective gene expression**, and the environment, in turn, influences their fitness and phenotype ‚Äî forming a feedback loop that mimics **learning without cognition**.

## üß† Conceptual Components

| Component                | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cells**                | Yeast cells with GFP expression, division time, and stress-based behavior |
| **GFP Expression**       | Binary (low/high) or continuous (Gaussian inheritance)                    |
| **Temperature Feedback** | Adjusted based on mean GFP in the *driver well*                           |
| **Fitness**              | Depends on temperature and GFP (high GFP = higher cost)                   |
| **Phenotypic Switching** | Modeled as noise under stress; can trigger state changes                  |
| **Moran Process**        | Population capped; excess cells are removed randomly or by fitness        |
| **Multi-Well Design**    | Simulates: 1 **driver well**, N **passive wells**, and 1 **control well** |

## üß™ Simulation Features

- Flexible feedback logic (linear, exponential, sigmoid, etc.)
- Optional Gaussian inheritance of GFP
- Multiple passive wells sharing temperature
- Control condition with fixed stress (39¬∞C)
- Tracks:
  - GFP levels
  - Temperature
  - Generation times
  - Cell divisions
- Supports interactive exploration via a **Streamlit app**

---

## üß¨ Biological Modeling

### Learning Analogy:
- **Driver well**: GFP expression affects environment (adaptive feedback)
- **Passive wells**: Share environment, but cannot influence it
- **Control well**: Constant temperature; no learning

This design mimics experimental microfluidics setups where only one well is feedback-coupled.

## üîß Simulation Function Summary

### `Cell` class
- Handles division logic and phenotype tracking

### `feedback_temperature(mean_gfp, mode, ...)`
- Converts mean GFP into temperature using selectable functions

### `determine_gfp(...)`
- Two inheritance modes:
  - **Binary Jumping**: stress-driven switches between GFP low/high
  - **Gaussian Inheritance**: continuous phenotype with small noise

### `background_switching(...)`
- Allows phenotype switching independent of division

### `fitness(...)`
- Calculates fitness for death-selection based on GFP and temperature
