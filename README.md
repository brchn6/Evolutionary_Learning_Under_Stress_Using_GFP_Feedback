# 🧬 Evolutionary Learning Laboratory

**Interactive simulation platform for studying temperature-feedback driven adaptation in synthetic yeast populations**

This bioinformatics tool implements both binary and continuous GFP expression modes with Moran process dynamics to explore how microbial populations can "learn" through environmental feedback mechanisms. Based on real experimental designs in synthetic biology, it provides a powerful platform for understanding evolutionary adaptation without cognition.

## 🧬 Scientific Background

### The Experimental System
This simulation models a **synthetic biology experiment** where yeast cells (S. cerevisiae) are engineered to link GFP expression with environmental temperature feedback:

- **🎯 Driver Well**: GFP expression directly controls temperature (learning enabled)
- **🔄 Passive Wells**: Follow driver temperature but cannot influence it (learning disabled)  
- **🔬 Control Wells**: Fixed at 30°C (optimal) and 39°C (stress) temperatures
- **⚖️ Moran Process**: Constant population size with fitness-proportional reproduction
- **💰 Fitness Cost**: High GFP expression slows cell division (metabolic burden)

### Key Biological Processes
1. **Temperature Feedback**: Higher mean GFP → Cooler environment (reward)
2. **Fitness Trade-off**: GFP expression costs energy → Slower division
3. **Stress Response**: Hot temperatures → Increased GFP switching probability
4. **Inheritance**: Daughter cells inherit mother's GFP ± noise
5. **Selection**: Faster-dividing cells have more offspring
